        <p>Well well. Vals day huh.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I remember the vals day we celebrated together when I created a video for you, and the other with the letter.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was gonna write a letter initially, but thinking of the first one got me thinking.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“How can we preserve these memories without them getting destroyed, and also lower transportation costs?”</p>
        <br>
        <p>That’s when I decided to make this website. A new way to communicate with you, without the need to meet, yet cause the same surge of emotions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now, for the message.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I sent you the past video cuz that was our first val's day. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Those days, you hated yourself, but I knew if you owned the body you have, everyone else would admire your beauty.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Low and behold, you begun loving yourself, and see how you’ve bonded with new amazing friends.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You even have boys flocking over you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I’m happy you’re in this era and pray it keeps going on like this cuz you seriously deserve all the good things happening to you right now.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Your tears cannot be forgotten, but luckily they make us appreciate these happy times even more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For this val’s day, I’m here to say this year will definitely be your stepping stone to amazing feats.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Outstanding grades, remarkable memories and most importantly, trustworthy friends.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Happy val’s day madam and hope you have the best time of your life in Academic and beyond.</p>
        <br>
